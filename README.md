# Euler Approximation Project

## Description
This is a project to approximate values of y for a differential equation at different values of h using the Euler Approximation method.

## What was the motivation for this project?
This was a project for the Series and Differential Equations class (Math 23) at SCU. The Goal of this project was to understand the step by step process of the euler approximation method and understand how and why the Euler Approximation Method is an effective tool when dealing with ordinary differential equations.

## Technologies used in the creation of this project
* Emathhelp.net was used for performing the computations of each Euler approximation.
* D3, a javascript datavisualization library, was used to plot the points created by each approximation in problem 1.
* Darryl Nester's Slope Field Generator was used to calculate the slope field of the differntial equation in problem two.
* Mathjax was used to render the LaTeX on this webpage.
* Lastly, A Bootstrap theme from bootswatch was used for styling.
